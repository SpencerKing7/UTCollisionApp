        <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
        <p class="mb-0">Utah has a unique set of challenges when it comes to motor vehicle accidents. For example, although alcohol is still a problem, it may be less of a problem in Utah than distracted driving. Lawmakers need to understand these unique challenges better in order to regulate effectively. A dataset has been collected on motor vehicle collisions during three years: 2016, 2017, and 2019. This dataset does not include every collision from each year and, clearly, 2018 is missing. However, we will work with what we have. </p>
        <br /><p class="mb-0">Store this data in a searchable database and create a web application that will allow two types of users: database readers and database writers. Readers should be able to view all of the data including summaries and predictions. Writers should have all privileges of the readers including the ability to add/view/update/delete records.</p>
        <br /><p class="mb-0">The data should be searchable and include a variety of summaries and predictions that you believe will help regulators make better decisions. At a minimum, you should generate a model to predict crash severity–an ordinal variable scored from 1=no injury, 2=possible injury, 3=suspected minor injury, 4=suspected serious injury, and 5=fatal. This model should be trained and made available for various data features that you will creatively determine and add to your application. However, the model training including all data cleaning and import should appear in a single .ipynb file that facilitates TA grading. You do not need to automate model retraining for the purposes of INTEX. However, the ways in which you use that trained model in your web app is up to you. Be creative. You will be graded on how useful the evaluators believe your creative data features will be. For example, the dataset includes a feature indicating whether distraction was involved in the accident. You could add a feature that allows users to assume they are distracted and see a predicted level of crash severity for themselves based on where they live.</p>
